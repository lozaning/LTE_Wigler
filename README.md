For use in the LillyGo Sim7000G, scans for wifi and then makes a git request to a cloud kismet server

This is shit code that you probably shoudlnt use

You're welcome to try to hit the IP in this code with the tokens in the code, they wont work cause I dont pay for that DO droplet anymore ;)
In that same vain, you need to stand up your own publically accessible kismet server, create a log in token for it, and then update this code with that info
Make sure to change your provider info h2g2 is only for google fi
